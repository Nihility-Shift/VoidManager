### üéÆ Client Usage

- `F5` ingame will bring up a menu which lists all installed `Void Manager` plugins and their mod settings.
- `/` is the prefix for client commands. `/help` lists all commands available.
- `!` is the prefix for public commands. `!help` lists all public commands available.

### üë• Multiplayer Functionality 

**Complex** - VoidManager handles mods connectiveity to prevent mods not configured for VoidManager from joining vanilla games. If all mods are configured for VoidManager as Client mods, clients will be allowed to join vanilla games. This behaviour is to prevent mods which break vanilla clients from doing so.  
By default, any given mod must be installed by the host for clients to join. The host can configure this setting with VoidManager via the F5 menu (ModManager > Mod Settings > VoidManager > Trust MPType.Unspecified mods). Additionally, Mods configured for VoidManager can change this setting.

---------------------

## üîß Install Instructions - **Install following the normal BepInEx procedure.**

Ensure that you have [BepInEx 5](https://thunderstore.io/c/void-crew/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) (stable version 5 **MONO**) and [VoidManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/void-crew/p/VoidCrewModdingTeam/VoidManager/) installed.

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Mod installation - **Unzip the contents into the BepInEx plugin directory**

### ü§î Development Guide - **Documentation to create Void Manager mods is** [on the wiki](https://github.com/Void-Crew-Modding-Team/VoidManager/wiki)

### Future Plans:

- mod whitelist/blacklisting
- Downgrading to [client] session tag based on mod types, and the ability to join vanilla sessions with Non-Game Influencing mods.
